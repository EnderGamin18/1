### The Basics  
In Anagrams, players are given a set of either 6 or 7 letters. The objective of the game is to arrange the given letters into valid English words.  
### How to use  
First, download the `anagram_tool.py` and `letters7.txt` files and place them all in the same directory. You can invoke the tool by running  
```
> python3 anagram_tool.py
```  
Once you do this, you will be asked how many letters are given (either 6 or 7). Next, you will be prompted for the letters on the board. After entering them, there will be 10 words displayed at a time, unless you type 'a' to see the entire list at once.
