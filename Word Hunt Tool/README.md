# Word Hunt  
### The Basics  
In Word Hunt, players are presented with a 4x4 board of letter tiles. In order to earn points, players must connect adjacent tiles on the board to form English words. The longer the word, the more points the player earns. Whoever scores more points in 80 seconds wins.
