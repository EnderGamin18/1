# Notes as I go (for version control)  
3.27.21: 5:30am
- runs, seemingly computes best move, but is slow
- had to temporarily remove the zobrist table functionality because it was broken
- after implementing any improved board evaluation functions
- added colors for the game pieces (always on, maybe add color-mode option later)
- changed the client file a bit to make playerColor global and expanded printBoard function
- code needs to be cleaned up for comments and extra unnecessary functions
