# Mancala (Avalanche)  

### Java Version  
#### How to use
First, go into the `Java Version` directory and download the `MancalaAvalanche.java` and `MancalaBoard.java` files. Then, run the following command:  
```
> javac MancalaAvalanche.java
```  
Once you have run the above command once, you won't have to run it again, unless you make changes to either one of the `.java` files. Now, to run the program, run the following command:  
```
> java MancalaAvalanche
```  
You will be prompted for which mode you would like to use (have the moves presented all at once, or one at a time). Next, you will be prompted to enter your side of the board, followed by the opponent's side of the board. Make sure your input is a comma separated list with exactly 6 numbers. You will be presented with a visualization of the board as you have inputted it. Pressing enter will calculate the best possible moveset for that given board.
