### What is Game Pigeon?
[Game Pigeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamePigeon) is a mobile gaming app for iOS devices. The app allows iMessage users to play each other in minigames such as chess, mancala, anagrams, battleship and more.  

### Why did I make this?
My friend and I are pretty competitive, and one way we compete is in these Game Pigeon games. Each game we bet $1 on the outcome. Some of these games rely on strategy and recognition, which means you can write programs to give you the upper hand.  

The first program I wrote was for the [Anagrams](https://github.com/k-gerner/Game-Pigeon-Solvers/tree/master/Anagrams%20Tool) game, back in February of 2020. After that, I wrote the Java version of the solver for the avalanche mode in [Mancala](https://github.com/k-gerner/Game-Pigeon-Solvers/tree/master/Mancala%20Avalanche), shortly followed by the Python version. Lastly, I wrote the [Word Hunt](https://github.com/k-gerner/Game-Pigeon-Solvers/tree/master/Word%20Hunt%20Tool) tool in February 2021. There are a few other games available in the Game Pigeon app that I have my eyes on as well.
