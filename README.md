### What is Game Pigeon?
[Game Pigeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamePigeon) is a mobile gaming app for iOS devices. The app allows iMessage users to play each other in minigames such as chess, mancala, anagrams, battleship and more.  

### Why did I make this?
My friend and I are pretty competitive, and one way we compete is in these Game Pigeon games. Each game we bet $1 on the outcome. Some of these games rely on strategy and recognition, which means you can write programs to give you the upper hand.  

The first program I wrote was for the [Anagrams](https://github.com/k-gerner/Game-Pigeon-Solvers/tree/master/Anagrams%20Tool) game, back in February of 2020. After that, I wrote the Java version of the solver for the avalanche mode in [Mancala](https://github.com/k-gerner/Game-Pigeon-Solvers/tree/master/Mancala%20Avalanche), shortly followed by the Python version. Next, I wrote the [Word Hunt](https://github.com/k-gerner/Game-Pigeon-Solvers/tree/master/Word%20Hunt%20Tool) tool in February 2021. I also wrote the [Word Bites](https://github.com/k-gerner/Game-Pigeon-Solvers/tree/master/Word%20Bites%20Tool) tool and [Connect 4 A.I.](https://github.com/k-gerner/Game-Pigeon-Solvers/tree/master/Connect%204%20AI) tool in March 2021. Lastly, I wrote the [Gomoku A.I.](https://github.com/k-gerner/Game-Pigeon-Solvers/tree/master/Gomoku%20AI) over the course of a few months from March to May 2021. This was by far the most complex project out of all of these, and it is easily the one I am most proud of. I also quickly coded a [Tic-Tac-Toe A.I.](https://github.com/k-gerner/Game-Pigeon-Solvers/tree/master/Tic%20Tac%20Toe%20AI) one night in June since it was essentially just a watered-down version of the Connect 4 and Gomoku AIs. There are a few other games available in the Game Pigeon app that I have my eyes on as well.
