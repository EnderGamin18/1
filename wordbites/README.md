### The Basics  
In Word Bites, players are presented with a 9x8 board of open space. 
Scattered around the board are several letter tiles, which can be 
either 1 or 2 letters long, and can be oriented vertically or 
horizontally. In order to earn points, players must connect pieces 
on the board to form English words. The longer the word, the more 
points the player earns. Whoever scores more points in 80 seconds 
wins.
### How to use
First, download this project. You can invoke the tool by running  
```
> python3 ai_runner --game=wordbites
```
Once you do this, you will be prompted about which display mode you 
would like to use: `Diagram Mode`, or `List Mode`. Typing `i` will 
give you more information about each of them.  
After this, you will be asked to input the letter tiles in 3 different 
categories: single letters, horizontal pieces, and vertical pieces. 
Then, the program will calculate and display the best piece 
combinations.
#### Diagram Mode
Diagram mode will display each word one at a time, along with a visual 
representation of how to arrange the board pieces. Longer words will 
be displayed first.

#### List Mode
List mode will display every possible word on the board all at once, 
along with the orientation of the word, either saying `V` for 
vertical, or `H` for horizontal. Longer words will be displayed first.

### âœ¨ New in Version 1.1
* The output will now be updated in place, instead of printing 
* additional output to the terminal. This can be turned off with the 
* command line argument `-e` or `-eraseModeOff`.
* In List Mode, the direction indicator will now be colored to make 
* it easier to distinguish at a glance. Horizontal `H` will be light 
* blue, and Vertical `V` will be yellow.
